## Brief History on Zork
Excerpt from https://www.thezorklibrary.com/whatiszork.php
> Zork is a series of classic video games in the genre known as adventure games, which are about exploring strange places, solving mysterious puzzles, and surviving bizarre scenarios...Zork has a few things that make it unique from those later games, though. It is actually one of the oldest computer game franchises, with the first game making its public debut in 1980. Because of this, newcomers to the series might be shocked to discover upon loading up the original game that there's not a single graphic in sight. The early games in the series are an example of a sub-genre of adventures known as text adventures or interactive fiction. What this means is that the game takes place in a turn-based environment where the game will display text on the screen as if you were reading a book, and then you, playing the part of the main character of the story, will type in what you want your character to do next in the story. It's sort of like a Choose-Your-Own Adventure book, but much more open to exploration and experimentation.
