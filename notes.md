- two word commands (addmore)
- parser: resposnible to allow us to type things in - parses up input into command 
- room class - rooms have name, descirption, and hasmap of exits
- some items found in rooms will have letters -> enter them at the end? 



- tem have weight 
each item has same weight exceptpt for items that stay in he room 
each item - weight = 1 unless it is stationalty

TO DO: 
- NEED TO ADD LOCKED ROOM FUNCTION: 
- room inventory
- locked door garage 
- better descirptions 
- add newspaper in oldtown square 
- at end, change game LONGDESCRIPTION() TO SHORT DESCRIPTION OR EVEN JUST DESCIRPTION
